#### A Deployment for Each Push

Now for GitLab will **deploy each push by default**. This includes pushes and pull requests made to branches. This allows those working within the project to preview the changes made before they are pushed to production.

With each new push, if Now is already building a previous commit, it will cancel that current build to start the most recent commit, ensuring you always have the latest changes deployed as quickly as possible.

#### Updating the Production Domain

If production domains are set from the project domains dashboard, pushes and merges to the [default branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/#default-branch) (commonly "master") will be made live to those domains with the latest deployment made with a push.

If you decide to revert a commit that has already updated a product domain, the previous commit's deployment will automatically be made available at the production domain instantly; providing you with instant rollbacks.

#### Preview URLs for Each Merge Request

The latest push to any pull request will automatically be made available at a unique preview URL based on the project name, branch, and team or username. These URLs will be given through a comment on each merge request.
