#### A Deployment for Each Push

Now for GitHub will **deploy every push by default**. This includes pushes and pull requests made to branches. This allows those working within the repository to preview changes made before the changes are pushed to production.

With each new push, if Now is already building a previous commit, Now will cancel that current build to start the most recent commit so that you always have the latest changes deployed as quickly as possible.

#### Updating the Production Domain

If production domains are set from the project domains dashboard, pushes and merges to the [default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/) (commonly "master") will be made live to those domains with the latest deployment made with a push.

If you decide to revert a commit that has already updated a production domain, the previous commit's deployment will automatically be made available at the production domain instantly; providing you with instant rollbacks.

#### Preview URLs for the Latest Changes for Each Pull Request

The latest push to any pull request will automatically be made available at a unique preview URL based on the project name, branch, and team or username. These URLs will be given through a comment on each pull request.

#### Deployment Authorizations for Forks

If you receive a pull request from a fork of your repository and there is either a change to the [`now.json`](/docs/configuration) file or there are [secrets](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets#adding-secrets) used in your project; Now will require an authorization from you or a member of your team to deploy the pull request.

This behavior protects you and your project from a leak of sensitive information.
