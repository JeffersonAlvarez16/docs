You may want to use different workflows and APIs based on the environment of the deployment based on Git information. To support that, ZEIT Now will deploy your app with the following built-in [environment variables](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets) when deploying with ZEIT Now for Bitbucket:

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BITBUCKET_DEPLOYMENT`         | An indicator for whether the app was deployed by ZEIT Now for Bitbucket. |

| `BITBUCKET_COMMIT_REF`         | The branch that the app was deployed using.                              |
