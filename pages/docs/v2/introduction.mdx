ZEIT Now is a cloud platform for **static sites** and **Serverless Functions**. It enables developers to host websites and web services that **deploy instantly**, **scale automatically**, and requires **no supervision**, all with **no configuration**.

Getting started with Now takes only a few steps and lets you get up and running with your new project in less than a minute.

## Deploy and Existing Project

Once you have signed up to ZEIT, you can use our Git integrations with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to deploy an existing project by selecting a repository from your Git account.

Get started connecting a Git integration from the ["New Project"](/new) page under the "From an existing project" section and selecting the tab of the Git service you'd like to connect to.

With a Git account connected, head back to the ["New Project"](/new) page, and under the same tab as you connected, create a new project from you project repository.

Alternatively, if you want to start fresh with a new project, use a Quickstart template from below.

## Quickstarts

Quickstarts let you get started quickly. The following quickstarts are paired with guides and a deploy button, based on the example found in the [Now repository](https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples), to help you get going with your project as fast as possible.

<Quickstarts>
  {quickstarts.map(({ name, ...quickstart }) => (
    <Quickstart quickstart={name} {...quickstart} />
  ))}
</Quickstarts>

## Deploying a Project Locally

If you like to do things manually, you can deploy with ZEIT Now through your terminal with any local project.

To deploy with ZEIT Now through your terminal, you will need to install [Now CLI](/download), a frequently updated, and [open-source](https://github.com/zeit/now), command-line interface.

You can get Now CLI from either npm or Yarn. Using npm, run the following command from your terminal:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="npm i -g now"
/>
<Caption>Installing Now CLI with npm in the terminal.</Caption>

To verify that you have installed Now CLI, try running `now help` from your terminal.

With Now CLI installed, you can now login using the following command:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="now login"
/>
<Caption>Login with Now CLI from the terminal.</Caption>

Logged in, you can type the following command to deploy from your project's repository:

<Snippet
  dark
  text="now"
/>
<Caption>Deploying with Now CLI from the terminal.</Caption>

Once deployed, you will get a preview URL that is assigned on each deployment to share the latest changes under the same address.

The preview URL will look like the following: <https://my-next-project.now-examples.now.sh/>
