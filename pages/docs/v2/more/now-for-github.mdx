The Now for GitHub integration features:

- Deploys every push in branches and pull requests to preview changes live
- Updates production domains with the most recent changes from the master branch
- Instant rollbacks for production domains when reverting changes

## Default Behavior

### A Deployment for Each Push

Now for GitHub will **deploy every push by default**. This includes pushes and pull requests made to branches. This allows those working within the repository to preview changes made before the changes are pushed to production.

With each new push, if Now is already building a previous commit, Now will cancel that current build to start the most recent commit so that you always have the latest changes deployed as quickly as possible.

### Updating the Production Domain

If production domains are set from the project domains dashboard, pushes and merges to the [default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/) (commonly "master") will be made live to those domains with the latest deployment made with a push.

If you decide to revert a commit that has already updated a production domain, the previous commit's deployment will automatically be made available at the production domain instantly; providing you with instant rollbacks.

### Preview URLs for the Latest Changes for Each Pull Request

The latest push to any pull request will automatically be made available at a unique preview URL based on the project name, branch, and team or username. These URLs will be given through a comment on each pull request.

### Deployment Authorizations for Forks

If you receive a pull request from a fork of your repository and there is either a change to the [`now.json`](/docs/configuration) file or there are [secrets](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets#adding-secrets) used in your project; Now will require an authorization from you or a member of your team to deploy the pull request.

This behavior protects you and your project from a leak of sensitive information.

## Extending Your GitHub Workflow

Now for GitHub uses the deployment API to bring you an extended user interface both in GitHub, when showing deployments, and Slack, if you have notifications setup using the [Slack GitHub app](https://slack.github.com).

You will see all of your deployments, production or preview, from within GitHub in its own page. See the page for this very documentation: <https://github.com/zeit/docs/deployments>

Due to using GitHub's Deployments API, you will also be able to integrate with other services through [GitHub's checks](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-status-checks). Now for GitHub will provide the deployment URL to the checks that require it, for example; to a testing suite such as [Ghost Inspector](https://ghostinspector.com/docs/integration/github/).

## Configuration

### Disabling Production Domain Updates

To prevent Now from [automatically updating production domains](#updating-the-production-domain), use the following configuration option in a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "github": {
    "autoAlias": false
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  This example is of an entire <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file with the
  noted configuration option to disable automatically updating production
  domains with Now for GitHub.
</Caption>

### Disable Commenting with Silent Mode

To prevent Now from commenting on pull requests and commits, use the following configuration option in [a `now.json` file](/docs/configuration) for the repository you want to stop this behavior in.

<Note>
  Although Now will stop commenting, it will not stop deploying the latest
  updates. For this configuration option, see{' '}
  <Link href="#disabling-now-for-github-with-now.json">
    disabling Now for GitHub
  </Link>
</Note>

```json
{
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

### Disable Auto Job Cancellation

To prevent Now from canceling in-progress builds to prioritize building newer commits, use the following configuration option in [a `now.json` file](/docs/configuration) for the repository that this behavior should exist in.

```json
{
  "github": {
    "autoJobCancelation": false
  }
}
```

## Included Environment Variables

You may want to use different workflows and use different APIs based on Git information.<br/>

## Required GitHub Permissions

We require some permissions through our Now for GitHub integration. Below are listed the permissions required and a description for what they are used for.
