ZEIT Now provides integrations for your [GitHub](#github), [GitLab](#gitlab), and [Bitbucket](#bitbucket) projects, allowing for **automatic deployments on every branch push** and merge to the default branch.

The ZEIT Now Git integrations provide the following benefits:

- Deployments for every push in branches and pull/merge requests to preview changes live.
- Production domains updated for the most recent changes from the default branch.
- Instant rollbacks when reverting changes assigned to a production domain.

The easiest way to use a Git integration is to think of your **default branch as production**. Every time a pull/merge request is made to the default branch, Now will **create a unique deployment**, allowing you to **view the changes in a preview environment before merging**.

## Available Integrations

- [GitHub](#github)
- [GitLab](#gitlab)
- [Bitbucket](#bitbucket)

## Installation

You can install any Git integration directly from your dashboard by clicking ["New Project"](/new), then from the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket tabs in the "From your existing code" section, then clicking the connect button.
