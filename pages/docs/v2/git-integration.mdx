ZEIT Now provides integrations for your [GitHub](#github), [GitLab](#gitlab), and [Bitbucket](#bitbucket) projects, allowing for **automatic deployments on every branch push** and merge to the default branch.

The ZEIT Now Git integrations provide the following benefits:

- Deployments for every push in branches and pull/merge requests to preview changes live.
- Production domains updated for the most recent changes from the default branch.
- Instant rollbacks when reverting changes assigned to a production domain.

The easiest way to use a Git integration is to think of your **default branch as production**. Every time a pull/merge request is made to the default branch, Now will **create a unique deployment**, allowing you to **view the changes in a preview environment before merging**.

Once you have authorized the Now integration, you will redirect back to your ZEIT dashboard.

To deploy GitLab projects, you will need to explicitly link them from the GitLab section in your [account](/account) or team settings page, or through the [New Project workflow](/new). Without linking a project, no deployments will be made.

<Note>
  You can link projects across all the GitLab namespaces you have access to and
  unlink a project at any time.
</Note>

For more information on deploying projects, read [the ZEIT Now introduction documentation](/docs).
